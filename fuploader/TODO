TODO
1. trigger workload on upload, check job status
- Separate the server from the chunk/file storage. Currently its tied to webapp server (we write to local disk). If we had multiple backends, diff chunks might go to diff backends.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
POC:
User uploads a file (and a password?)
Gets a link to download the file when its ready

The backend receives the file
Process it (appends whatever is necessary)
Makes it available for download on the specified link (with a password?)
