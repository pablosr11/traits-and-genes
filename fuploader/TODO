TODO
1. upload file to upload/uniquefileID
2. return a link /results/uniquefileID
3. that links returns work in progress for N seconds, then returns sample file

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
POC:
User uploads a file (and a password?)
Gets a link to download the file when its ready

The backend receives the file
Process it (appends whatever is necessary)
Makes it available for download on the specified link (with a password?)
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\


How do we diferrentiate between diff files? 
    Add identifier on upload and upload to specific path /upload/3904684098
    Backend accepts wildcard and uses it to group them together.
